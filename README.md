# Investigate-titanic-data-set

This is a Udacity Data Analyst Nano Degree (DAND) Project, in which the Titanic dataset was invetigated. Although there were some elements of luck involved in surviving the sinking, it is highly possible that some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. The questions raised for this investigation are:

- Was social status a factor in survival? (Were upper-class passengers more likely to survive?)
- Did women and children have a better chance to survive?
- What was the age distribution in survival?
- Did passengers by themselves or with their families aboard tend to survive?
